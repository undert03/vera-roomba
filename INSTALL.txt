Installation
-----------

- Extract your the Vera Roowifi Roomba zip file you downloaded from here 

- Uploads contents of icons folder to: /www/cmh/skins/default/icons (using WinSCP)

- Uploads contents of libs folder to: /usr/lib/lua (using WinSCP)

- Navigate to apps --> develop apps --> Luup files in vera UI

- Add all 4 files under the luup files folder you extracted from the zip *check restart luup after upload

- Reload Vera

- Create a new device (apps --> develop apps --> Create device), in the field "Upnp Device Filename" you enter D_Roomba1.xml, leave the rest empty and click Create Device

- Save and Reload Vera

Configuration
-----------

In the Advanced tab of the plugin

Address : IP Address of your Roowifi
Username: your Roowifi username (default: admin)
Password: your Roowifi password (default: roombawifi)

If you have no password make both the Username and Password field blank

Save and Reload Vera (sometimes multiple reloads necessary)	

Configuration for Scheduled Cleaning
-----------

- Create your Scene where you set the desired Roomba to Clean
- Click the LUUP tab
- Paste the following 
```
luup.variable_set("urn:undertoe-us:serviceId:Roomba1", "ScheduledClean", 1, YOUR_ROOMBA_DEVICE_ID )
```

* YOUR_ROOMBA_DEVICE_ID can be found by clicking on the Settings (Wrench Icon) of your device, then the advance tab. Where it says "Device #111" 111 would be your device id.

There are trigger options now for schedule cleaning ( Started, Completed, Interrupted, Failed) that are now active when you
start your scenes with the above method. So you can now be alerted if your Roomba actually completed after you scheduled a clean.

Also useful for shutting down your HVAC fan during cleaning if you want to prevent dust from getting kicked up and circulated through your
house.
